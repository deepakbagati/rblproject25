## AI-Powered Counseling and Mentoring Portal

This project is an AI-driven platform designed to provide personalized counseling and mentoring services. The system leverages advanced AI technologies to facilitate seamless interactions between users and virtual mentors. The key features of the platform include:

- Speech-to-Text Conversion:** Powered by **Whisper**, allowing users to communicate with the system via voice, which is transcribed in real-time.
- AI-based Response Generation:** Using **Claude**, the system processes user inputs and generates insightful, contextually accurate responses to offer guidance and mentoring.
- Text-to-Speech Output:** Implemented through **ElevenLabs** to convert the generated responses back into speech, providing a natural conversational experience.
- Virtual Avatar with Lip Syncing:** Integrated with **Loopy**, the system features a virtual avatar that mimics lip movements in sync with the generated speech, enhancing user engagement.
- Intelligent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** The platform uses a **vector database** and a fine-tuned **LLM (Large Language Model)** to ensure that the responses are both accurate and relevant to the user's needs, providing a more personalized and efficient mentoring experience.

This project aims to offer users reliable and accessible counseling and mentoring, combining cutting-edge AI technologies to create a smooth and interactive experience.
